<!-- version control system- 
sometimes softwares work somethimes they dont, this leads us to trace back to the checkpoints to see where the code was working fine, this 
is called version control  -->
commands/ to create and push a repo from terminal- <!--
    mkdir xys creates xyz folder, 
    ls- shows the existing folders, if no folders then no output
    git --version shows the version
    cd xyz- takes us to that folder/initislaises it
    git status- shows status of git folder
    cd .. - used to get back one folder or out of directory 
    ls -Force -shows all the hidden files
    
    git rm --cached abc - used to untrack file from staging area and bring it back to not added version
    git reset --soft HEAD~1- used to undo the commit operation so the file goes back to the tracked/added version
    git reset --hard HEAD~1- used to completely delete the committed file from the repo/branch/folder  -->
    
    Touch- will not work because it is a unix cmd not recognised by the powershell
    <!-- New-Item xyz.txt- creates a new file in the folder
        Set-Content xyz.txt to create or overwrite an empty file.--> 
    creates folder + file and shows them, now reay to add to staging area, then track it and commit it w a msg, then push 
    staging area is like in intermediate zone before we commit, we can go ahead and stage and also go behind and unstage from here <!-- 
    git add. -add all files to staging area/ git add xyz abc- only 2 specified files
    commit -m "add file"- -m is used for adding a message
    git commit -am "sffh" - used for adding and commiting at the same time
     git log- shows
    commit d58264701a75a2f2bd65a21d84958af0f6c74e8d (HEAD -> master)

    git log --oneline(gives log of the information and shows in oneline)
    d582647 (HEAD -> master) commit this file
    
    git config --global user.name/email- sets the global username for Git commits and returns the name and email,and this setting will be 
    used on all repositories on your machine, and it shows the name and email associated with the account
    git config --global core.editor "code --wait"- sets the default text editor as visual studio code, --wait flag tells us to wait till we 
    finish editing the file, meaning when we have to edit something git will open vscode and wait untill we save and exit the editor
    
    git ignore- read by git itself and we have to create it
    
    pwd- gives the home directory of the entire computer(Path -C:\Users\sharv\gitone )
    
    git --config --global --list -is a global file and gives the overall info
    
    branches are used as checkpoints, when we have to fix a bug or add a new pointer to the features, it acts as a pointer to the snapshot of chnages
    git branch- there is a master branch, which has all nodes on which commits have been made, thsi shows the current branch which we are on 
    git branch abc- creates a new branch 
    
    git checkout/switch abc- checksout from current branch and changes from master to abc
    in vsc in gitone this is shown in gitone/.git/log/ref/nav-bar
    git checkout -b abc/git switch -c abc- creates a new branch named "abc" and will move the current pointer to that created branch
    
    merging branches- to merge branches, first we have to verify that all the commits have been made after staging, only then we can merge 
    git merge abc- opens vsc w current window which you're working on and gives a message of merging the branches, then we can save it and close 
    the file because code --wait will wait till we close the file completely after editing, then the merging will show in the terminal  
    git branch --merge used to see a list of all merged branches
    
    git branch -d nav-bar - deletes branch nav-bar(used to del branch)
    git rm abc- deletes a file created by New-Item abc in a specific branch
    
    rename a file- git mv abc xyz(abc file is reanmed as xyz) this can happen only when the file is in working directory, hence it is always a good 
    idea to switch branches to the one you want
    to work in.
    
    git only tracks the files in the current pointing branch, hence if the branch is pointing to master, it wont show footer.html/foot.html which
    are created until they are tracked or added by git, hence they will disappear either until tracked or until pointed to footer branch
    
    git diff- shows the difference between the same files at different times, like maybe before/after staged, before/after commits etc, when the 
    same file was operated on, on 2 diff timelines
    ---/+++ these are used to show the same file for before/after of an operation, before commiting lets say and after commiting, not for adding
    or removing those files
    a file is the one before operating and b is after operating- hence ---a/+++b files are present
    
    git stash- takes away uncommitted changes (both tracked and untracked) and saves them for later use, this isn't limited to a branch and we can
    stash one branch and pop those changes in other branch and can see the stashed changed in other branch as well
    git stash pop- Removes a single stashed state from the stash list and apply it on top of the current working tree state, 
    eg-
     git diff index.html
    PS C:\Users\sharv\gitone> git diff --staged (used to show the staged changes)
    diff --git a/foot.html b/foot.html(foot because ut was foot before then changed to index)
    deleted file mode 100644
    index e69de29..0000000
    diff --git a/index.html b/index.html
    new file mode 100644
    index 0000000..5033aef
    --- /dev/null
    +++ b/index.html
    @@ -0,0 +1,3 @@
    +<head>
    +
    +</head>
    \ No newline at end of file
    
    we cannot switch a branch if we haven't commited the curreny work yet, if there are any files in staging area then we have to first commit 
    all the reuired changes and only then can we  move tp a diff branch
    
    git diff --summary HEAD (this cmd is used for showing the summary of changes comapred to the last commit by HEAD )
     delete mode 100644 foot.html( file is renamed as index hence foot gets deletes)
     create mode 100644 index.html
    
    git stash- create a repo, work on it then commit it, after that switch to a new branch and work there
    
    git rebase- command used for merging and cleaning up all commits, it should never be run on a master/main branch, always do on a side branch,
    re-applies commits from one branch into another base branch
    
    git branch -M abc renames the current pointing branch to abc
    git remote -v is used to check if there's any remote repo being set, local is on my system and remote is in github, named as origin, meaning push my main branch into 
    origin  
    git remote add origin (link of the repo)- used to create a remote repo on github used to push the codes from your main/master branch
    git remote rename oldname newname - used to rename the repo, can change from origin to abc
    
    once git push -u origin main is done on that specific repo, from next time onwards you wont be needing to add origin main, since -u works as an upstream and knows where 
    to push the desired code now
    
    git clone (link of the repo you wnat to clone)- we can clone a diff repo and bring it onto our server and use it as our own repo
    
    fetch and pull- if you're actively working on a repo brings the updated code from the repository which someone else has updates into your 
    computer, except the fetch only brings the work into a your remote repo and pull brings it onto our working area, say on vsc
    git pull= git fetch + git merge   
    
    git.hidden stores all of its metadata and version history

    eg-
    <!-- PS C:\Users\sharv\gitone> git branch ->cmd given 
    * master ->points to the master branch
    PS C:\Users\sharv\gitone> git branch nav-bar ->cmd which adds another file in gitone/.git/head/nav-bar
    PS C:\Users\sharv\gitone> git checkout nav-bar
    A       .gitignore
    Switched to branch 'nav-bar'
    PS C:\Users\sharv\gitone> git branch (this shows that now the branch is pointing to the nav-bar )
      master
    * nav-bar   
    --> 
    
    
    
    eg-
    <!--  cd/Users/sharv
    mkdir gitone
    ls (shows existing if not then no op)
    ls -Force (shows hidden files- .git)
    cd .git(takes us to .git file)
    ls(gives op)
